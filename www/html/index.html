    <h1>Hashimoto, the original CEO, is a new billionaire, worth $1.2 billion based on the IPO price. Chief technology officer Dadgar’s shareholdings are worth $1.5 billion, but about $1.2 billion is held in a charitable trust; Forbes does not count shares held in irrevocable charitable entities toward a person's net worth and a HashiCorp spokesperson did not respond to an inquiry on the nature of Dadgar’s trust at the time of publication. (Update: shares closed at $85.19 on the first day of trading, a 6.5% increase from the IPO price, which increased the market cap to about $15 billion. Hashimoto’s net worth is now $1.3 billion and Dadgar’s total holdings are valued at $1.6 billion, or about $330 million excluding the charitable trust.)</h1>
